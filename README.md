# Ghost-In-The-Graveyard
Ghost in the Graveyard is a thrilling multiplayer search and hide game that pits players against each other in a game of stealth and strategy. In this game, one player assumes the role of the "ghost," who must hide somewhere in the playing area while the other players become "seekers."

The ghost's goal is to avoid being caught by the seekers while completing a series of missions, which may involve collecting items or reaching specific locations. The seekers, on the other hand, must use their wits and observation skills to find and tag the ghost before the time runs out.

To make things more challenging, the playing area is filled with obstacles such as tables, trees, and chairs, which the players can use to hide and sneak around. The seekers must be careful not to overlook any hiding spots, while the ghost must use their agility and quick thinking to evade detection.

With multiple rounds and varying missions, Ghost in the Graveyard is a game that offers endless possibilities for fun and excitement. Whether you're playing with a group of friends or competing against strangers, this game is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!
